# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
An assignment was given to utilize Python and Pandas in order to create a summary DataFrame organized by the city types: rural, suburban, and urban. In addition to this, a graph that presents the total fares of each city type throughout January to April and a single graph. Based on the information of the DataFrame and graph, there needs to be some suggestions on what would be best decisions for the company's interest.

As seen from the DataFrame, there is an increasing trend from rural areas to urban in the number of drivers, number of rides, and total fares. However, this would be typical for rides needed in these sort of areas as urban cities has a much larger customer base than in rural areas. Besides this, the table presents a decreasing trend in average fare per ride and average fare per driver, where these two data tended to decrease with the city type. However, the most alarming part of this table would be the massive decrease in the "average fare per driver" column where the table stated that the rural areas averaged about $8.06 dollars per driver but urban areas earn about $0.67 per driver.

Besides the DataFrame, the graph displayed above presents the weekly fares over the course of four months in 2019. One key point in this chart would be how the city types are compared. It is shown throughout the graph that urban has the greatest total fare throughout the graph, followed by suburban cities and rural cities being last. However, another important concept this graph displays is that the fares tend to be stable throughout the four months. There is no clear display of a trend within these four months.  

## Summary


There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
